Justin is a software wanderer, split keyboarder, and floor sleeper.

In 2022, Justin interned at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) in San Francisco and graduated from Georgia Tech with a BS in computer science.
Later in 2023, he started posting computing-related content on Twitter and worked as a Hacker in Residence at [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), building tools to improve developer usefulness of semantic embeddings.
After that, Justin returned as a full time Site Reliability Engineer at Atlassian, this time in New York City.
At Atlassian, he primarily works on distributed systems and devops shenanigans to improve the reliability and performance of [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/product/).

Justin has many goals, but above all he cares about understanding and simplifying systems.
