Hi, I'm Justin Liang.

I grew up in Dallas, Texas and later got a B.S. in computer science from Georgia Tech. I currently live in New York City and work at Atlassian doing site reliability engineering.

Previously, I did some tinkering with embedding models and LLMs, but nowadays am focused on programming fundamentals.

In my free time, I enjoy wandering the city and chronically browsing [Streeteasy](https://streeteasy.com/) ðŸ˜¹. I also have a fascination with ergonomic keyboards and old websites.
