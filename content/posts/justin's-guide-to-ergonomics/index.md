In February 2023, I lost my ability to type.

Due to a severe case of RSI (repetitive strain injury), I was left unable to type or using a mouse for many months. During this time, I fell into the rabbit hole of ergonomic keyboards in an attempt to regain the functionality in my hands. After trial and error with multiple ergonomic setups, I've managed to regain the use of my keyboard and am able to physically function in a full time software engineering job today.

In this guide, I hope to share some of what I learned; this is a guide I wish that I had when I first lost the ability to type.

## Ergonomic Hardware

The foundation of how we interact with computers is via the keyboard.

Due to our 10 fingers, the amount of informational bandwidth we're able to send from our intentions to our computers via a keyboard is greater than any other medium. This is why it's paramount to make sure your keyboard is something that is optimized for you personally.

### Level 1: learn touch typing

Touch typing is the foundation of using your keyboard ergonomically. It allows you to use your keyboard efficiently and sustainably.

While it's sometimes associated with typing via muscle memory without looking at the keys, that's only half of the true definition. The other half of touch typing invovling placing your fingers on the **home row** of your keyboard as their base position, and using that as a jumping off point to reaching the other keys.

If you take away nothing else from this guide, learning to touch type is a great start.

### Level 2: modifying keybindings

The simplest and quickest way of modifying your existing keyboard for your personal needs is to make sure the keys your pressing are in comfortable places.

Take for example the `escape` key. On standard keyboards, this key is placed in top left corner, a very uncomfortable position to reach to. Go ahead and try to press it on your own keyboard (if applicable) while staying in the **home row**; pretty much impossible, right?

The solution to fixing this is to move the `escape` key to a more comfortable position. For example, it can be rebound to the `caps lock` key, a much more reachable key to press while also replacing a key with not much functionality (why press `caps lock` when you can hold `shift`?).

This principle can be applied to pretty much every key, depending on the programmability of your keyboard.

### Level 3: buying an ergonomic setup

Buying the correct ergonomic setup is a highly personal process. Because of that I will only briefly go over what it means to begin researching for your own ergonomic setup.

#### Ergonomic Keyboard

* split keyboard help to open your shoulders and allow mobility
* keyboard tenting promotes healthier wrist pronation
* lower actuation force switches make it easier to type
* programmable keybindings and layering allow reduces the need to awkwardly stretch for far keys
* thumb clusters allow you make better use of your strongest finger (rather than just devoting it to a space bar)

#### Ergonomic Mouse

* vertical mouse is a good alternative to the basic mouse since it promotes helathier wrist pronation
* reduce your mouse sensitivity if you need to reduce awkward forearm movement, increase your mouse sensitivity if you need to reduce awkward wrist movement
* touch pads are good for reducing awkward forearm movements when

#### Desk/Chair

* using a standing desk can improve shoulder pain due to better posture

## Ergonomic Software

I find that maximizing keyboard use is important for computer ergonomics since it promotes speed (less shifting between mouse and keyboard) and comfort. This is highly dependent on your personal use case though, i.e. some applications are unuseable without a mouse.

### Level 1: learn keyboard shortcuts

Invest time in learning the keyboard shortcuts of whatever software you use. It could be as simple as using `cmd+space` to open spotlight search (on MacOS) to learning the intricacies of Excel macros. Whatever it is, it will help you move faster on your computer, letting you spend less time on it.

### Level 2: window management

Window management software is important to keep your windows in a predictable place and managed via keyboard rather than manually dragging them. I would recommend [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for MacOS since it's free OSS that does the job well.

### Level 3: learn Vimium

{{< youtube t67Sn0RGK54 >}}

Your web browser is most likely your most used computer software, but it isn't natively built to support keyboard-only navigation. A solution to this is to use [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), a way to navigate your browser using your keyboard inspired by [vim](https://www.vim.org/).

Although it can seem daunting at first to learn, the core of vimium is in these 5 keys:

* `f`: click on links/buttons on a webpage
* `k`: scroll up
* `j`: scrol down
* `H`: go backwards one page
* `L`: go forwards one page

In combination with these default browser keybindings, you can eliminate 95% of your mouse usage. (Note these are on Google Chrome MacOS)

* `ctrl+tab`: jump to the next open tab
* `ctrl+shift+tab`: jump to the previous open tab
* `cmd+tab`: create a new tab

## Conclusion

Your computer is a tool that should be continuosly molded to fit your personal needs; from choosing the right keyboard for your specfic hands to experimenting with different keyboard shortcuts for your own workflows.

Note that there is a lot that I haven't covered with regards to computer ergonmics specifically for programmers, since this guide is geared for the general user.
