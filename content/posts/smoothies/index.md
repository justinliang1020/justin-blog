## Recipe

| Ingredients        | Quantity                           | Notes                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Frozen Mango       | 1 portion                          | none                                   |
| Other Frozen Fruit | 1 portion                          | cherry, strawberry, peach, etc.        |
| Milk               | fill to height of fruit in blender | cow, oat, or almond, etc.              |
| Honey              | 1-2 seconds of squeezing           | preferrably in bear-shaped container   |
| Blender            | 1 blender                          | preferably a personal smoothie blender |
| Straw (optional)   | 1 straw                            | preferably reusable and thick          |

1. Combine all ingredients in a blender, adding the fruit first, then milk, then honey.
2. Blend the ingredients until desired consistency, shaking the blender if the fruit ever gets stuck.
   A blend may take ~3 rounds of 10-15 second blending, so about 30-45 seconds of total blend time (this depends on your blender).
3. Serve, preferably with a thick straw.

## Details

I prioritize convenience, taste, and speed when making smoothies.
I currently get all of smoothie ingredients from Trader Joe's (fruit, milk, honey) since it is the main grocery I shop at.

Currently, I only use frozen fruits in my smoothies for the convenience and texture.
I always get the same frozen fruits from Trader Joe's since they are low-cost and consistent in availability and quality.
Since they are pre-frozen, it reduces a lot of effort needed to manually process and freeze fruits (I wish frozen bananas were commonly sold)!
Frozen fruits are vastly superior to non-frozen ones when it comes to smoothie texture and shelf-life, so they are no-brainers to use.
I've experimented with using non-frozen fruits and ice, and the overall texture of these don't seem to be as smooth.
It's possible that a more high-powered blender is required for this method, but I haven't tried that.
One caveat is that the non-frozen fruits and ice method retains small ice crystals in the smoothie which can add crunchiness to the texture.

One unique aspect of my recipe is that I almost always include mangos.
The reason for this is that after experimenting with different smoothie combinations from Trader Joe's frozen fruits, I've found that the only combination that doesn't produce a smoothie with a sour taste is mango + any other fruit.
The other commonly available fruits, cherries, strawberries, and peaches, are all slightly acidic/sour meaning they require the neutral taste of the mango to balance them out.
Blueberries are another frozen fruit available at Trader Joe's; however, I almost never use them in smoothies since they produce an unappetizing, heterogeneous texture because blending blueberries results in their skins not being fully blended.
My favorite combination currently is mango + cherry since it produces a pretty pink color and tastes the most refreshing out of the combinations I've tried.

Next, the choice of liquids is important but simple.
Any milk-related product seems to work for this and doesn't impact the overall taste/texture very much.
I began making smoothies using only whole milk, but after a few months I stopped using it since my milk-usage was inconsistent resulting in the milk to spoil.
In addition, I began experimenting with avoiding dairy as a whole during that time period so I decided to use milk alternatives.
First, I used almond milk since I viewed it as the standard milk alternative.
It worked fine and I didn't notice a significant taste difference in my smoothies from using actual milk.
Later though, I began to dislike the taste of almond milk when drinking it by itself since I thought it was too strong and desired something more neutral.
I began purchasing Trader Joe's oat beverage (basically oat milk) and have been using it regularly since.
In terms of quantity of liquid, I always eyeball it and fill up my blender cup to about the level of the highest pieces of fruit.

In order to sweeten my smoothies a little, I also add a small quantity of honey (about 1-2 seconds of squeezing the honey bear container).
I had previously tried adding more honey than this but found the taste of honey to overpower the fruit.
I find the current quantity I use strikes a nice balance between adding sweetness without an apparent honey flavor.
I didn't notice any textural differences when first adding honey, but it's possible that it's slightly contributed to the smoothness of the smoothies.

Blending was something that took a while to understand how to do effectively.
In short, blend for slightly longer than you think it should take.
This ensures that every fruit chunk is fully pulverized so the smoothie is fully smooth.
Also, it aerates the smoothie which adds a creaminess to the texture of the smoothie.
I usually do this for about 30-45 seconds of total blending.
The blender I use is the [Ninja Nutri-Blender Pro](https://www.ninjakitchen.com/products/ninja-nutri-blender-pro-with-auto-iq-zidBN401) and it works well for me as a personal smoothie blender (I have no in-depth knowledge on different blender types, but I am satisfied with this one).
I like that it includes a 24oz cup that you can drink your smoothie out of rather than having to transfer it to an external container, greatly simplifying the cleaning process.
Cleaning is straightforward but it's important to be diligent.
This involves thoroughly washing the cup and blender cap with soap and water.
When I initially started making smoothies, I wasn't as diligent with cleaning my equipment leading to unfavorable, bacteria-like tastes in some of my smoothies.

Initially, I drank my smoothies straight out of the container.
Now, I use a thick, reusable straw and find it to be a much more pleasant drinking experience.
First, the straw makes every sip easier than drinking directly from the cup which requires more attention due to the potential for spillage.
Previously, I've had many unpleasant instances where the contents of the smoothie would clump up and fall on my face when I rotated the cup vertically to drink from it.
Since using a straw, this never happens since I don't have to rotate the contents of the cup.
This is important since I usually watch anime while drinking my smoothie so I no longer have to remove my attention from the screen to drink my smoothie.
Next, the straw reduces the chance of any tiny fruit chunks from getting stuck in my teeth since the liquid now flows directly into my throat.
I've noticed much less fruit-related food scraps since in my teeth doing this (although this could also be from blending my smoothies more thoroughly).
Lastly, it just feels like a more delightful, sophisticated experience to drink from a straw.
The only con of using a straw is that I have to clean it after every use, so I use a straw-cleaning brush for this.
