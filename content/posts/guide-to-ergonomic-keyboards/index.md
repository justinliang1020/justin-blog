## personal preface

I began dealing with RSI(repetitive strain injury) in my arms in February 2023. It started as a minor pain in my right forearm whenever I would type for a long period of time, and progressed to the point of losing the ability to type or use a mouse for longer than 5 seconds at a time. As a college new grad about to start a full-time programming job in July 2023, watching myself day-by-day lose the ability to use a computer terrified me.

This put me on a timeline: I needed to recover within the next 5 months before my job would start, or else I would effectively become unemployed.

Here is everything I did to heal myself. Take everything I say here with a grain of salt, as the fixes I implemented are personal to me. Every person's physical differences will change what works and what doesn't.

### What helped

* **Rest:** This is by far the best way of quickly healing RSI. Avoid all keyboard/mouse usage for a few weeks (time depends on the severity of injury) to give your muscles time to rest and repair from the inflammation its received. Although this isn't practical for most people employed with jobs that require using a computer, try your best to go on medical leave/PTO to fix this quickly.

* **Avoiding using the mouse:**

### What didn't help (in the long term)

* **Physical therapy exercises:**
* **Anti-inflammatory medication:**
* **Massage gun:**

### What I learned

The only cure is to treat the cause of the issue rather than address the symptoms. The cause here being the fact that **computers are physiologically unnatural**. AFter I modified
