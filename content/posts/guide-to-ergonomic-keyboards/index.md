## personal preface

I began dealing with wrist pain/repetitive strain injury since the February 2023. It started randomly as minor pain in my right forearm whenever I would type on my macbook, and eventually this pain progressed to the point of being unable to type anything longer than a few words or to navigate any website using a mouse. As a college new grad about to start a full-time software engineering job in July 2023, the idea of losing the ability to use a computer terrified me.

This put me on a timeline: I needed to recover within the next 5 months. Here is what I did according to what helped, and what didn't. Take everything I say here with a grain of salt, as the fixes I implemented are personal to me. Every person's physical differences will make changes that work for one person null for another.

### What helped

* Rest: While I don't know the exact cause of my wrist pain, it was likely due to some sort of inflamation in the muscles of my wrist, forearm, and/or shoulder. Avoiding computer usage and anything that triggered pain would help reduce the inflammation and speed up recovery.
* Ergonomic Keyboard:
* Avoiding using the mouse:

### What didn't help (in the long term)

* Physical therapy exercises:
* Anti-inflammatory medication:
* Massage gun:

### What I learned

The only cure is to treat the cause of the issue rather than address the symptoms. The cause here being the fact that **computers are physiologically unnatural**. AFter I modified
