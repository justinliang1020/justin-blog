**TLDR:** Using a computer for many decades of your life requires deliberately practicing sustainable habits when using them, else you will fall be prone to malaise from the lack of fundamental ergonomics from modern computers.

## Personal Anecdote

I began dealing with RSI(repetitive strain injury) in my arms in February 2023. It started as a minor pain in my right forearm whenever I would type for a long period of time, and progressed to the point of losing the ability to type or use a mouse for longer than 5 seconds at a time. As a college new grad about to start a full-time programming job in July 2023, watching myself day-by-day lose the ability to use a computer terrified me.

This put me on a timeline: I needed to recover within the next 5 months before my job would start, or else I would effectively become unemployed.

Here is everything I did to heal myself. Take everything I say here with a grain of salt, as the fixes I implemented are personal to me. Every person's physical differences will change what works and what doesn't.

### What helped

* **Rest:** This is by far the best way of quickly healing RSI. Avoid all keyboard/mouse usage for a few weeks (time depends on the severity of injury) to give your muscles time to rest and repair from the inflammation its received. Although this isn't practical for most people employed with jobs that require using a computer, try your best to go on medical leave/PTO to fix this quickly.
* **Ergonomic Keyboard:** Having a split, ergonomic, and programmable keyboard helped personalize my recovery process since I could adjust my keyboard position/typing movements to anything I needed.
* **Avoiding using the mouse:** This is very specific to me, but I have never found using the mouse to be comfortable, even a vertical ergonomic one. Perhaps I will try trackball mice in the future.
* **Frequent movement:** The best position when sitting all day is no position. Frequently move around, take breaks, and change to a standing desk position if applicable.

### What didn't help (in the long term)

* **Physical therapy exercises:** While they provided some temporary relief for some pain, doing these any type of stretching or exercises didn't help the root cause of my RSI
* **Anti-inflammatory medication:** These can defintely help temporarily relieve inflammation, but aren't a good long term solution if your RSI is chronic.

Eventually, after a combination of rest and better ergonomic practices on the computer, I was able to overcome 90% of my RSI pain and have been able to work in my currently programming position without it hindering me for almost the past year.

## Computers are un-ergonomic by default

I found that the only cure for RSI is to treat the cause of the issue rather than just addressing the symptoms. The cause here being the fact that **the way we interface with computers is, by default, physiologically unnatural and damaging**.

## Computers interfaces should adapt to humans, not vice versa

When I was a child, I used to love playing video games on my Wii not by sitting on the couch, but by jumping up and down in front of our TV screen while holding my controllers. It made me feel more immersed in whatever game I was playing. I thought what I was doing was completely normal until my friends visited me one day to play video games and questioned why I did that instead of just sitting down. Looking back, I think of this as a time when my interface with a computer didn't physically restrict me. In this situation the Wii controllers adapted to me and further enhanced my immersion in the game; I wasn't forced to adapt to it.

For computers today, users can improve their personal ergonomics with computers by tinkering with the hardware and software used to interface with it.

For hardware, programmable keyboards are a great way to customize your personal workflows to your needs.

For software, custom tools like vimium enable ways of browsing the web that allow individuals to tkae more control that allow individuals to tkae more control
