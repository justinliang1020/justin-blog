## Now

I have a week off from work this week without any definitive plans on what to do.
I've made normal plans i.e. going to tech/nature random events around the city which I'm excited about.
But, I feel this urge to dedicate my time to some person project since I've now have the most uninterrupted free-time I've had in a while.
I don't know if this is healthy.
My need to "get ahead" in my career has subsumed my past life's satisfaction with simple leisure.

Besides that, I believe I've made some (?) progress on at least the knowledge of my chronic nerve pain.
I believe it to be a muscular imbalance in my right shoulder blade.
While I can't be 100% sure this is the cause for the pain, I've found previously that healing asymmetries can be powerful to focus on when navigating chronic pain.
For reference, I previously had right knee pain for about a year and half, preventing me from running/biking.
After focusing on healing a tightness in my achilles tendon area through intensive stretching, the pain has disappeared.

I'm currently in my apartment building sitting on the floor typing.
I'm trying out a new ergonomic keyboard setup where I put my spit keyboard on a small cutting board that rests on my lap while I sit in a criss-cross position.
The monitor is about 2 feet away from me and sitting on a small ottoman on the floor.

I still am combatting my chronic nerve pain via physical therapy, exercise, and postural improvements.
I've been experiencing it in one form or another for the past 1.5 years.
I am however optimistic that it could improve.
This is since the pain, while constant, has changed in its form.
The type of pain that mainly involved a tightness centered in my hand has healed.
However, a different pain of nervous tingling and shoulder pain is still more prominent, which I'm not 100% certain was there at the start.

Anyways, besides that I'm doing the same old activities of exploring areas of new york city.
Today I went to McCarren park with some friends (i currently have a polaroid image of me taped somewhere in this park if you can find it).
We then went to a used book store where I bought a copy of [Johnny the Homicidal Maniac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_the_Homicidal_Maniac) since I'm a big Invader Zim fan.
Lastly we went to a coffee shop where we talked to the barista about his previous life working as a software engineer for a government agency.
