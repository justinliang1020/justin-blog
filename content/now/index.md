Last updated 2024-08-24 in New York City.

I'm currently in my apartment building sitting on the floor typing.
I'm trying out a new ergonomic keyboard setup where I put my spit keyboard on a small cutting board that rests on my lap while I sit in a criss-cross position.
The monitor is about 2 feet away from me and sitting on a small ottoman on the floor.

I still am combatting my chronic nerve pain via physical therapy, exercise, and postural improvements.
I've been experiencing it in one form or another for the past 1.5 years.
I am however optimistic that it could improve.
This is since the pain, while constant, has changed in its form.
The type of pain that mainly involved a tightness centered in my hand has healed.
However, a different pain of nervous tingling and shoulder pain is still more prominent, which I'm not 100% certain was there at the start.

Anyways, besides that I'm doing the same old activities of exploring areas of new york city.
Today I went to McCarren park with some friends (i currently have a polaroid image of me taped somewhere in this park if you can find it).
We then went to a used book store where I bought a copy of [Johnny the Homicidal Maniac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_the_Homicidal_Maniac) since I'm a big Invader Zim fan.
Lastly we went to a coffee shop where we talked to the barista about his previous life working as a software engineer for a government agency.
