# Justin blog

Justin's blog

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

### Development

Run the following command to run this website locally

```sh
hugo server
```

## Obsidian

I use obsidian to edit markdown files in my blog.

Static images are stored in the path `static/justin-blog/attachments` due to obsidian compatibility, see: https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/is-there-a-simple-way-to-display-images-in-hugo/49627/8

See obsidian vault README for instructions how to sync files from obsidian into `justin-blog`
